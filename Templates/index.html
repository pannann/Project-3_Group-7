        <h2>How to Use the Dashboard:</h2>
        <p>
            Our dashboard is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly. 
            The dashboard is divided into three main sections: 
            the map, the charts, and the table. 
            The map provides a visual representation of the data, 
            allowing you to explore outbreaks by location. 
            The charts offer a more in-depth analysis of the data, 
            presenting key insights and trends. 
            Finally, the table provides a comprehensive overview of the data, 
            allowing you to filter and sort the data as needed.
